@article{Morales2011a,
abstract = {Although numerous studies have been conducted to discern colloid transport and stability processes, the mechanistic understanding of how dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects colloid fate in unsaturated soils (i.e., the vadose zone) remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the gap between the physicochemical responses of colloid complexes and porous media interfaces to solution chemistry, and the effect these changes have on colloid transport and fate. Measurements of adsorbed layer thickness, density, and charge of DOM-colloid complexes and transport experiments with tandem internal process visualization were conducted for key constituents of DOM, humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), at acidic, neutral and basic pH and two CaCl2 concentrations. Polymeric characteristics reveal that, of the two tested DOM constituents, only HA electrosterically stabilizes colloids. This stabilization is highly dependent on solution pH which controls DOM polymer adsorption affinity, and on the presence of Ca+2 which promotes charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging. Transport experiments indicate that HA improved colloid transport significantly, while FA only marginally affected transport despite having a large effect on particle charge. A transport model with deposition and pore-exclusion parameters fit experimental breakthrough curves well. Trends in deposition coefficients are correlated to the changes in colloid surface potential for bare colloids, but must include adsorbed layer thickness and density for sterically stabilized colloids. Additionally, internal process observations with bright field microscopy reveal that, under optimal conditions for retention, experiments with FA or no DOM promoted colloid retention at solid-water interfaces, while experiments with HA enhanced colloid retention at air-water interfaces, presumably due to partitioning of HA at the air-water interface and/or increased hydrophobic characteristics of HA-colloid complexes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of resistive pulse sensors for submicron particle size measurements relies on a clear understanding of pulse size distributions. Here, broadening of such distributions has been studied and explained using conical pores and nominally monodisperse polystyrene particles 200–800 nm in diameter. The use of tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) enabled continuous in situ control of the pore size during experiments. Pulse size distributions became broader when the pore size was increased and featured two distinct peaks. Similar distributions were generated using finite element simulations, which suggested that relatively large pulses are produced by particles with trajectories passing near to the edge of the pore. Other experiments determined that pulse size distributions are independent of applied voltage but broaden with increasing pressure applied across the membrane. The applied pressure could also be reversed in response to a pulse, which enabled repeated measurement of individual particles moving ...},

@article{Zhao2014,
abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles ({\textless}2??m) in soil has not been investigated. This study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (NOM), and solution chemistry. Specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using NOM-present, NOM-stripped soil colloids, Streptococcus suis SC05 and Escherichia coli WH09 over a wide range of solution pH (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (IS, 1-100mM KCl). Cell characterization techniques, Freundlich isotherm, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. The adhesion coefficients (Kf) of S. suis SC05 to NOM-present and NOM-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than E. coli WH09, respectively. Similarly, Kf values of S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 adhesion to NOM-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with NOM-present, respectively, suggesting NOM inhibits bacterial adhesion. Cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing pH and enhanced with rising IS (1-50mM). Interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by DLVO-type forces, with S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. S. suis SC05 adhesion decreased at higher IS 100mM, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on S. suis SC05 surface as compared to E. coli WH09. Hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of DLVO, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A linear relationship, as first suggested by Maxwell, between particle volume and change in electric resistance across the pore was observed. Particle sizes were quantified for a given size-tunable membrane, by first creating a linear calibration curve to a series of monodisperse carboxylated polystyrene particles of various diameters and then applying this curve to calculate the size of “unknown” nanoparticles. The diameters of a selection of synthetic and biological particles, being PMMA and nonfunctionalized polystyrene particles, along with biological nanoparticles (adenovirus) were calculated using this methodology. Calculated particle diameters and coefficients of variation were shown to be in good agreement with both transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results.},

@article{Mayne2016,
abstract = {A tunable resistive pulse sensor, utilising a polyurethane nanopore, has been used to characterise nanoparticles as they traverse the pore opening. Herein we demonstrate that the translocation speed, conductive and resistive pulse magnitude, can be used to infer the surface charge of a nanoparticle, and act as a specific transduction signal for the binding of metal ions to ligands on the particle surface. Surfaces of silica nanoparticles were modified with a ligand to demonstrate the concept, and used to extract copper(ii) ions (Cu2+) from solution. By tuning the pH and ionic strength of the solution, a biphasic pulse, a conductive followed by a resistive pulse is recorded. Biphasic pulses are becoming a powerful means to characterise materials, and provide insight into the translocation mechanism, and herein we present their first use to detect the presence of metal ions in solution. We demonstrate how combinations of translocation speed and/or biphasic pulse behaviour are used to detect Cu2+ with quantitative responses across a range of pH and ionic strengths. Using a generic ligand this assay allows a clear signal for Cu2+ as low as 1 ppm with a short 5-minute incubation time, and is capable of measuring 10 ppm Cu2+ in the presence of 5 other ions. The method has potential for monitoring heavy metals in biological and environmental samples.},

@article{Philippe2014,
abstract = {This contribution critically reviews the state of knowledge on interactions of natural colloids and engineered nanoparticles with natural dissolved organic materials (DOM). These interactions determine the behavior and impact of colloids in natural system. Humic substances, polysaccharides, and proteins present in natural waters adsorb onto the surface of most colloids. We outline major adsorption mechanisms and structures of adsorption layers reported in the literature and discuss their generality on the basis of particle type, DOM type, and media composition. Advanced characterization methods of both DOM and colloids are needed to address insufficiently understood aspects as DOM fractionation upon adsorption, adsorption reversibility, and effect of capping agent. Precise knowledge on adsorption layer helps in predicting the colloidal stability of the sorbent. While humic substances tend to decrease aggregation and deposition through electrostatic and steric effects, bridging-flocculation can occur in the presence of multivalent cations. In the presence of DOM, aggregation may become reversible and aggregate structure dynamic. Nonetheless, the role of shear forces is still poorly understood. If traditional approaches based on the DLVO-theory can be useful in specific cases, quantitative aggregation models taking into account DOM dynamics, bridging, and disaggregation are needed for a comprehensive modeling of colloids stability in natural media.},

@article{Sirivithayapakorn2003,
abstract = {[1] We present experimental evidence of the effect of colloid exclusion from areas of small aperture sizes, using direct observations at the pore-scale using a realistic micromodel of porous media. Four sizes of hydrophobic latex spheres in aqueous suspension, from 0.05 to 3 mm, were introduced into the micromodel at three different pressure gradients. We observed the frequency of occurrence of the size exclusion effect and the influence of relative size of pore throats and colloids ( T/C ratio) and flow velocity. From our observations the smallest T/C ratio entered by these different colloids was 1.5. We also observed certain preferential pathways through the pore space for different colloid sizes, such that size exclusion eventually results in distinct pathways. These preferential paths become more important for larger colloids and for greater pressure gradients. Measured colloid velocities were 4-5.5 times greater than estimated pore water velocities. Acceleration factors ( ratio of colloid to water velocity) increased for all colloid sizes with increasing pore-scale Pe. Smaller particles appeared to travel along faster streamlines in pore throats, while larger particles travel along with a number of streamlines, thus at a slightly lower velocity than the small colloids. At larger scales the acceleration factor is decreased owing to Brownian motion, adsorption, colloid and straining filtration, and other factors, but these pore-scale results shed light on the size exclusion effect and its role in determining early colloid breakthrough.},

@article{Sen2006,
abstract = {In this review article, the authors present up-to-date developments on experimental, modeling and field studies on the role of subsurface colloidal fines on contaminant transport in saturated porous media. It is a complex phenomenon in porous media involving several basic processes such as colloidal fines release, dispersion stabilization, migration and fines entrapment/plugging at the pore constrictions and adsorption at solid/liquid interface. The effects of these basic processes on the contaminant transport have been compiled. Here the authors first present the compilation on in situ colloidal fines sources, release, stabilization of colloidal dispersion and migration which are a function of physical and chemical conditions of subsurface environment and finally their role in inorganic and organic contaminants transport in porous media. The important aspects of this article are as follows: (i) it gives not only complete compilation on colloidal fines-facilitated contaminant transport but also reviews the new role of colloidal fines in contaminant retardation due to plugging of pore constrictions. This plugging phenomenon also depends on various factors such as concentration of colloidal fines, superficial velocity and bead-to-particle size ratio. This plugging-based contaminant transport can be used to develop containment technique in soil and groundwater remediation. (ii) It also presents the importance of critical salt concentration (CSC), critical ionic strength for mixed salt, critical shear stressor critical particle concentration (CPC) on in situ colloidal fines release and migration and consequently their role on contaminant transport in porous media. (iii) It also reviews another class of colloidal fines called biocolloids and their transport in porous media. Finally, the authors highlight the future research based on their critical review on colloid-associated contaminant transport in saturated porous media. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Fang2009,
abstract = {The stability of TiO2 nanoparticles in soil suspensions and their transport behavior through saturated homogeneous soil columns were studied. The results showed that TiO2 could remain suspended in soil suspensions even after settling for 10 days. The suspended TiO2 contents in soil suspensions after 24 h were positively correlated with the dissolved organic carbon and clay content of the soils, but were negatively correlated with ionic strength, pH and zeta potential. In soils containing soil particles of relatively large diameters and lower solution ionic strengths, a significant portion of the TiO2 (18.8-83.0{\%}) readily passed through the soils columns, while TiO2 was significantly retained by soils with higher clay contents and salinity. TiO2 aggregate sizes in the column outflow significantly increased after passing through the soil columns. The estimated transport distances of TiO2 in some soils ranged from 41.3 to 370 cm, indicating potential environmental risk of TiO2 nanoparticles to deep soil layers. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Keller2010,
abstract = {There is a pressing need for information on the mobility of nanoparticles in the complex aqueous matrices found in realistic environmental conditions. We dispersed three different metal oxide nanoparticles (TiO2, ZnO and CeO2) in samples taken from eight different aqueous media associated with seawater, lagoon, river, and groundwater, and measured their electrophoretic mobility, state of aggregation, and rate of sedimentation. The electrophoretic mobility of the particles in a given aqueous media was dominated by the presence of natural organic matter (NOM) and ionic strength, and independent of pH. NOM adsorbed onto these nanoparticles significantly reduces their aggregation, stabilizing them under many conditions. The transition from reaction to diffusion limited aggregation occurs at an electrophoretic mobility from around -2 to -0.8 m s-1 V-1 cm. These results are key for designing and interpreting nanoparticle ecotoxicity studies in various environmental conditions. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

@article{Lane2015,
abstract = {Exosomes are vesicles which have garnered interest due to their diagnostic and therapeutic potential. Isolation of pure yields of exosomes from complex biological fluids whilst preserving their physical characteristics is critical for downstream applications. In this study, we use 100 nm-liposomes from 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) and cholesterol as a model system as a model system to assess the effect of exosome isolation protocols on vesicle recovery and size distribution using a single-particle analysis method. We demonstrate that liposome size distribution and $\zeta$-potential are comparable to extracted exosomes, making them an ideal model for comparison studies. Four different purification protocols were evaluated, with liposomes robustly isolated by three of them. Recovered yields varied and liposome size distribution was unaltered during processing, suggesting that these protocols do not induce particle aggregation. This leads us to conclude that the size distribution profile and characteristics of vesicles are stably maintained during processing and purification, suggesting that reports detailing how exosomes derived from tumour cells differ in size to those from normal cells are reporting a real phenomenon. However, we hypothesize that larger particles present in most purified exosome samples represent co-purified contaminating non-exosome debris. These isolation techniques are therefore likely nonspecific and may co-isolate non-exosome material of similar physical properties.},

The goal is to provide a self-contained review of the concepts and the mathematics underlying clustering techniques. The chapter begins by providing measures and criteria that are used for determining whether two objects are similar or dissimilar. Then the clustering methods are presented, divided into: hierarchical, partitioning, density-based, model-based, grid-based, and soft-computing methods. Following the methods, the challenges of performing clustering in large data sets are discussed. Finally, the chapter presents how to determine the number of clusters.},

@article{Pevarnik2013,
abstract = {In this article, we report detection of deformable, hydrogel particles by the resistive-pulse technique using single pores in a polymer film. The hydrogels pass through the pores by electroosmosis and cause formation of a characteristic shape of resistive pulses indicating the particles underwent dehydration and deformation. These effects were explained via a non-homogeneous pressure distribution along the pore axis modeled by the coupled Poisson-Nernst-Planck and Navier-Stokes equations. The local pressure drops are induced by the electroosmotic fluid flow. Our experiments also revealed the importance of concentration polarization in the detection of hydrogels. Due to the negative charges as well as branched, low-density structure of the hydrogel particles, the concentration of ions in the particles is significantly higher than in the bulk. As a result, when an electric field is applied across the membrane, a depletion zone can be created in the vicinity of the particle observed as a transient drop of the current. Our experiments using pores with openings between 200 and 1600 nm indicated the concentration polarization dominated the hydrogels' detection of pores wider than 450 nm. The results are of importance for all studies that involve transport of molecules, particles, and cells through pores with charged walls. The developed inhomogeneous pressure distribution can potentially influence the shape of the transported species. The concentration polarization changes the interpretation of the resistive pulses; the observed current change does not necessarily reflect only the particle size but also the size of the depletion zone that is formed in the particle vicinity.},
