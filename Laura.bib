@article{Morales2011a,
abstract = {Although numerous studies have been conducted to discern colloid transport and stability processes, the mechanistic understanding of how dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects colloid fate in unsaturated soils (i.e., the vadose zone) remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the gap between the physicochemical responses of colloid complexes and porous media interfaces to solution chemistry, and the effect these changes have on colloid transport and fate. Measurements of adsorbed layer thickness, density, and charge of DOM-colloid complexes and transport experiments with tandem internal process visualization were conducted for key constituents of DOM, humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), at acidic, neutral and basic pH and two CaCl2 concentrations. Polymeric characteristics reveal that, of the two tested DOM constituents, only HA electrosterically stabilizes colloids. This stabilization is highly dependent on solution pH which controls DOM polymer adsorption affinity, and on the presence of Ca+2 which promotes charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging. Transport experiments indicate that HA improved colloid transport significantly, while FA only marginally affected transport despite having a large effect on particle charge. A transport model with deposition and pore-exclusion parameters fit experimental breakthrough curves well. Trends in deposition coefficients are correlated to the changes in colloid surface potential for bare colloids, but must include adsorbed layer thickness and density for sterically stabilized colloids. Additionally, internal process observations with bright field microscopy reveal that, under optimal conditions for retention, experiments with FA or no DOM promoted colloid retention at solid-water interfaces, while experiments with HA enhanced colloid retention at air-water interfaces, presumably due to partitioning of HA at the air-water interface and/or increased hydrophobic characteristics of HA-colloid complexes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The use of resistive pulse sensors for submicron particle size measurements relies on a clear understanding of pulse size distributions. Here, broadening of such distributions has been studied and explained using conical pores and nominally monodisperse polystyrene particles 200–800 nm in diameter. The use of tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) enabled continuous in situ control of the pore size during experiments. Pulse size distributions became broader when the pore size was increased and featured two distinct peaks. Similar distributions were generated using finite element simulations, which suggested that relatively large pulses are produced by particles with trajectories passing near to the edge of the pore. Other experiments determined that pulse size distributions are independent of applied voltage but broaden with increasing pressure applied across the membrane. The applied pressure could also be reversed in response to a pulse, which enabled repeated measurement of individual particles moving ...},

@article{Zhao2014,
abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles ({\textless}2??m) in soil has not been investigated. This study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (NOM), and solution chemistry. Specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using NOM-present, NOM-stripped soil colloids, Streptococcus suis SC05 and Escherichia coli WH09 over a wide range of solution pH (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (IS, 1-100mM KCl). Cell characterization techniques, Freundlich isotherm, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. The adhesion coefficients (Kf) of S. suis SC05 to NOM-present and NOM-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than E. coli WH09, respectively. Similarly, Kf values of S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 adhesion to NOM-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with NOM-present, respectively, suggesting NOM inhibits bacterial adhesion. Cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing pH and enhanced with rising IS (1-50mM). Interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by DLVO-type forces, with S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. S. suis SC05 adhesion decreased at higher IS 100mM, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on S. suis SC05 surface as compared to E. coli WH09. Hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of DLVO, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

A linear relationship, as first suggested by Maxwell, between particle volume and change in electric resistance across the pore was observed. Particle sizes were quantified for a given size-tunable membrane, by first creating a linear calibration curve to a series of monodisperse carboxylated polystyrene particles of various diameters and then applying this curve to calculate the size of “unknown” nanoparticles. The diameters of a selection of synthetic and biological particles, being PMMA and nonfunctionalized polystyrene particles, along with biological nanoparticles (adenovirus) were calculated using this methodology. Calculated particle diameters and coefficients of variation were shown to be in good agreement with both transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results.},

@article{Mayne2016,
abstract = {A tunable resistive pulse sensor, utilising a polyurethane nanopore, has been used to characterise nanoparticles as they traverse the pore opening. Herein we demonstrate that the translocation speed, conductive and resistive pulse magnitude, can be used to infer the surface charge of a nanoparticle, and act as a specific transduction signal for the binding of metal ions to ligands on the particle surface. Surfaces of silica nanoparticles were modified with a ligand to demonstrate the concept, and used to extract copper(ii) ions (Cu2+) from solution. By tuning the pH and ionic strength of the solution, a biphasic pulse, a conductive followed by a resistive pulse is recorded. Biphasic pulses are becoming a powerful means to characterise materials, and provide insight into the translocation mechanism, and herein we present their first use to detect the presence of metal ions in solution. We demonstrate how combinations of translocation speed and/or biphasic pulse behaviour are used to detect Cu2+ with quantitative responses across a range of pH and ionic strengths. Using a generic ligand this assay allows a clear signal for Cu2+ as low as 1 ppm with a short 5-minute incubation time, and is capable of measuring 10 ppm Cu2+ in the presence of 5 other ions. The method has potential for monitoring heavy metals in biological and environmental samples.},

@article{Philippe2014,
abstract = {This contribution critically reviews the state of knowledge on interactions of natural colloids and engineered nanoparticles with natural dissolved organic materials (DOM). These interactions determine the behavior and impact of colloids in natural system. Humic substances, polysaccharides, and proteins present in natural waters adsorb onto the surface of most colloids. We outline major adsorption mechanisms and structures of adsorption layers reported in the literature and discuss their generality on the basis of particle type, DOM type, and media composition. Advanced characterization methods of both DOM and colloids are needed to address insufficiently understood aspects as DOM fractionation upon adsorption, adsorption reversibility, and effect of capping agent. Precise knowledge on adsorption layer helps in predicting the colloidal stability of the sorbent. While humic substances tend to decrease aggregation and deposition through electrostatic and steric effects, bridging-flocculation can occur in the presence of multivalent cations. In the presence of DOM, aggregation may become reversible and aggregate structure dynamic. Nonetheless, the role of shear forces is still poorly understood. If traditional approaches based on the DLVO-theory can be useful in specific cases, quantitative aggregation models taking into account DOM dynamics, bridging, and disaggregation are needed for a comprehensive modeling of colloids stability in natural media.},
