@article{Morales2011a,
abstract = {Although numerous studies have been conducted to discern colloid transport and stability processes, the mechanistic understanding of how dissolved organic matter (DOM) affects colloid fate in unsaturated soils (i.e., the vadose zone) remains unclear. This study aims to bridge the gap between the physicochemical responses of colloid complexes and porous media interfaces to solution chemistry, and the effect these changes have on colloid transport and fate. Measurements of adsorbed layer thickness, density, and charge of DOM-colloid complexes and transport experiments with tandem internal process visualization were conducted for key constituents of DOM, humic (HA) and fulvic acids (FA), at acidic, neutral and basic pH and two CaCl2 concentrations. Polymeric characteristics reveal that, of the two tested DOM constituents, only HA electrosterically stabilizes colloids. This stabilization is highly dependent on solution pH which controls DOM polymer adsorption affinity, and on the presence of Ca+2 which promotes charge neutralization and inter-particle bridging. Transport experiments indicate that HA improved colloid transport significantly, while FA only marginally affected transport despite having a large effect on particle charge. A transport model with deposition and pore-exclusion parameters fit experimental breakthrough curves well. Trends in deposition coefficients are correlated to the changes in colloid surface potential for bare colloids, but must include adsorbed layer thickness and density for sterically stabilized colloids. Additionally, internal process observations with bright field microscopy reveal that, under optimal conditions for retention, experiments with FA or no DOM promoted colloid retention at solid-water interfaces, while experiments with HA enhanced colloid retention at air-water interfaces, presumably due to partitioning of HA at the air-water interface and/or increased hydrophobic characteristics of HA-colloid complexes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

New properties of nanomaterials have boosted their production and industrial applications in many fields (e.g., microelectronics, catalysis, fuel cells, materials science, textiles, biotechnology and medicine). In biomedical fields, nanomaterials are of the appropriate dimensions to interact with biological matter. However, they may also have negative effects on biological systems. Nanotechnology is a major, innovative, scientific and economic growth area, but the increasing production and use of nanomaterials have led to calls for more information regarding the potential impacts that their release may have on human health and the environment.This review addresses analytical approaches for characterization and quantification of nanomaterials in the environment and recent studies on their occurrence, fate and behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Weatherall2016,
abstract = {The use of resistive pulse sensors for submicron particle size measurements relies on a clear understanding of pulse size distributions. Here, broadening of such distributions has been studied and explained using conical pores and nominally monodisperse polystyrene particles 200–800 nm in diameter. The use of tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS) enabled continuous in situ control of the pore size during experiments. Pulse size distributions became broader when the pore size was increased and featured two distinct peaks. Similar distributions were generated using finite element simulations, which suggested that relatively large pulses are produced by particles with trajectories passing near to the edge of the pore. Other experiments determined that pulse size distributions are independent of applied voltage but broaden with increasing pressure applied across the membrane. The applied pressure could also be reversed in response to a pulse, which enabled repeated measurement of individual particles moving ...},

abstract = {Analytical technologies based upon superparamagnetic beads, SPBs, offer a rapid, simple and inexpensive way of separating and purifying the target analyte prior to detection. The SPBs can perform the capture, purification and the signal transduction stages, producing a simple, fast, and sensitive label-free format. Particle aggregation in the presence of the analyte is a common example of such a detection strategy. Herein we demonstrate the key parameters which lead to aggregation. We utilize a tunable resistive pulse sensing, TRPS, technology to follow the aggregation using three different methods of analysis. TPRS allows a comparison in the data treatment using average population values, particle concentration, and a more detailed analysis monitoring the change in aggregate size and frequency. To validate the approach, we use the well-known biotin-avidin binding assay to demonstrate the advantages and limitations of each type of analysis. Also presented are the key parameters that contribute to assay sensitivity such as bead concentration, size, binding capacities and data analysis.},

@article{Zhao2014,
abstract = {Bacterial adhesion to granular soil particles is well studied; however, pathogen interactions with naturally occurring colloidal particles ({\textless}2??m) in soil has not been investigated. This study was developed to identify the interaction mechanisms between model bacterial pathogens and soil colloids as a function of cell type, natural organic matter (NOM), and solution chemistry. Specifically, batch adhesion experiments were conducted using NOM-present, NOM-stripped soil colloids, Streptococcus suis SC05 and Escherichia coli WH09 over a wide range of solution pH (4.0-9.0) and ionic strength (IS, 1-100mM KCl). Cell characterization techniques, Freundlich isotherm, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory (sphere-sphere model) were utilized to quantitatively determine the interactions between cells and colloids. The adhesion coefficients (Kf) of S. suis SC05 to NOM-present and NOM-stripped soil colloids were significantly higher than E. coli WH09, respectively. Similarly, Kf values of S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 adhesion to NOM-stripped soil colloids were greater than those colloids with NOM-present, respectively, suggesting NOM inhibits bacterial adhesion. Cell adhesion to soil colloids declined with increasing pH and enhanced with rising IS (1-50mM). Interaction energy calculations indicate these adhesion trends can be explained by DLVO-type forces, with S. suis SC05 and E. coli WH09 being weakly adhered in shallow secondary energy minima via polymer bridging and charge heterogeneity. S. suis SC05 adhesion decreased at higher IS 100mM, which is attributed to the change of hydrophobic effect and steric repulsion resulted from the greater presence of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) on S. suis SC05 surface as compared to E. coli WH09. Hence, pathogen adhesion to the colloidal material is determined by a combination of DLVO, charge heterogeneity, hydrophobic and polymer interactions as a function of solution chemistry. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
