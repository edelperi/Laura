\begin{abstract}



Size and polydispersivity have an enormous influence on 
colloid transport in natural porous media and packed filters.
Coating of colloidal particles by natural polymers  adds complexity. 

Several techniques Light scattering has an intrinsic difficulty to resolve the particle size in polydisperse colloidal suspensions.
Tunable Resistive Pulse Scanning TRPS is new technique based on the Coulter principle that measures the particle size individually. This feature can be used to resolve the components of mixed sizes distributions in polydisperse aqueous suspensions.


In this work used TRPS and statistical clustering to resolve the components of a mixture of particle sizes in the range 
from $500$ to $2000~\mathrm{nm}$. 

These advantages were used to examine the coating of polystyrene by Humic Acids cation, polymer bridging and polymer stabilization.

\section{Introduction}

%Importancia de la distribución de tamaños de los coloides.

The most importance factor on the retention of colloid in porous media is the
particle size. Particle size distribution PSD has an enormous importance on the
behavior of substances in environment.
%Introducir citas y ejemplos.

%=========================================================================
%Aplicaciones 
Understanding  the role of the soil humic polymers on the colloid behavior of
natural and engineered particles in soil and porous media in general  may contribute to further technical developments based in the control of colloidal processes in fields related to 
water quality, environment, and public health~\cite{Ngo2008}
\cite{Farre2011}

Presence of HA and FA have a remarkable influence on the removal of metal contaminants 
\ce{Cr(VI)}  
and
\ce{As(V)} 
by zero-valent Fe nanoparticles~\cite{Mak2011234}.


%=========================================================================

%% El problema de determinación de tamaños en suspensiones de tamaños coloidales polidispersos

Dynamic light scattering (DLS)  cannot resolve variation in size as the scattering angle is increased through minima in the intensity form factor.
Some efforts have been made to characterize of the particle size distributions of colloidal particles with small polydispersities using a combination of DLS and static light scattering and two-color laser sources to avoid contributions from multiple scattering. However the results cannot discriminate different particle populations~\cite{Bryant2003AccurateSuspensions}. These authors report heavy tailed distributions but they do not report population mixtures.




\subsection{Polymer coating and colloid behavior}

%importancia de la cubierta polimérica y que efectos  tiene sobre el comportamiento de l.os coloides
Polymer coating by dissolved polymers affect dramatically the mobility of colloid-size particles in the aqueous environments.
For example, the retention of pathogenic microorganisms~\cite{Morales2011a}, ie., the travel distances along  subsurface environments, depends largely on characteristics of the polymer coating, cross linking can favor the coagulation,bridging flocculation,which enhances the colloid retention by several orders of magnitude. Conversely,  stabilization by adsorbed polymers can enhance transport.

The particle size effect dominated over the flow rate and organic matter polymer can block the adsorption sites in sand filters~\cite{Yang2015InterplayModeling}.

Conformation of polymers attached to particle surfaces is controlled by the cover density, pH and ions. These determine the polymer coiling. Therefore the size can of suspended colloids vary upon the electrochemical environment~\cite{Morales2011a}


Study of polymeric coating   on surfaces can be cumbersome,
~\citeauthor{doi:10.1021/es981236u}\cite{doi:10.1021/es981236u}
used  \ce{Si/SiO2} wafer strips  a coated with  polystyrene as support for
adsorption studies of HA laser-beam reflectometry. That procedure is
limited by technique of coating flat surfaces with a desired compound so, to date, that cannot be used with  natural colloids or microorganisms.

%Tamaño de los HA (esto puede ir a métodos) de momento no lo  ponemos
%Size of humic acid can be measured by several (electron microscopy, light scattering, size exclusion chromatography).  

%Basic structure and size of soil humic acids from a Dystric Cambisol (WRF) by small-angle X-ray scattering, and small-angle neutron scattering in $50~\mathrm{mM}$ \ce{NaOH\; Na2B3O7} buffer \ce{pH\, 10} was reported ~\cite{Kawahigashi1995}. They reported a core of high electron
%density with a radius of 
%$3.0~\mathrm{nm}$
%surrounded by branches with a radius of gyration between 
%$5.8$ to $7.5~\mathrm{nm}$.

\subsection{Particle size}
% En que consiste el TRPS
Particle size was measured by 
TRPS, this method determines the size of individual particles using the same principle of the Coulter method. The apparatus is qNano (iZon, Oxford) using the software
%Ventajas del TRPS 

TRPS has enough resolution to discriminate populations mixed in multimodal
samples polystyrene bead~\cite{Varenne2016MultimodalMethods}. 
In adition, TRPS does not disturb the geometry of the particle, such as  the
TEM or SEM, which need to dry the suspension before measurement.
%inconvenientes
One drawback of this technique is that electric conductivity of the buffer
used in the TRPS cell must met the requirements of current intensity and
voltage for accurate measurements of the blockades. This constitutes an
important limitation in the span of  experimental conditions  required in
extreme environments, i.e. seawater and extreme \ce{pH}s.
%
Another limitation is the representativity of the sample. Size is determined in a very small sample of particles, about  $500$ counts in samples with $10^9$ particles per liter.

%========================================================================
%Objectives
%========================================================================
The objective of this work was testing the capabilities of TRPS to identify
particle size mixtures in  polydisperse colloid suspensions.

In a primary approach the TRPS was used to examine the HA coating of
polystyrene latex beads by measuring the changes of the particle size
distribution.

\subsection{Particle size clustering}

Analysis of particle size populations was done by    
a model-based clustering, classification, and density estimation based on
finite Gaussian mixture modeling.  The clustering model used is the 
expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. 
Briefly, each population of a finite  mixture density is usually associated with a group or cluster. In this work we assume that all component densities arise from the same parametric distribution family. The model assumes a univariate Gaussian distribution for each component or cluster. In one dimension, there are just two models, all component have equal variance or varying variance among components.
The model selection was based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).
Details about the clustering procedure and information of the mclust library used for calculations can be read in 
~\citeauthor{Fraley2012MclustEstimation}\cite{Fraley2012MclustEstimation}. The mclust library is implemented in the R statistical package~\cite{RCoreTeam2011}.

%Resultado: floculacion excesiva por elevada fuerza iónica
High ionic strength in presence of HA causes an excessive flocculation in
few minutes. 
High flocculation rate imply that the aggregate size distributions shift towards sizes much larger than the measuring pore in the TRPS.
In addition, presence of large flocs in the conductivity cell of the TRPS apparatus precludes the 
small particles enter into the pore membrane. That results in low particle counts that are not representative.

%Evolución global de los tamaños
The moments relation or the particle sizes, moment 4 / moment 3,  is often used to
parametrize the particle population dynamics. This relation (Figure~\ref{fgr:moments43})
shows that HA increased the size of the microspheres. The contact time had a notable influence on the effect of HA. At short times,
$< 1~\mathrm{h}$, 
presence of HA was negligible but large times, 
$18 - 42~\mathrm{h}$,
produced a large increase in size.

%=========================================================================

Figure~\ref{fgr:boxplot_size} figure  shows the results of the particle size decomposition in three
different clusters. Note that particle size in the cluster no.~1 is smaller than the nominal particle size provided by the supplier. This is because this nominal size was used as reference size for calibration.  
%revisar esto
The cluster no.~2 is on the particle size reported by the manufacturer and the cluster no.~3 is above.
That indicates that TRPS
detects polydispersivity of the MS standards at early times, {\em i.e.} 5 min, in presence of \ce{CaCl2} and in absence of HA.


%% Cluster numero 1 azul 
The cluster no.~1 groups the particles in the range from $700$ to $810\;\mathrm{nm}$
the size of particles in the cluster no.~1 not varied upon the incubation time and the HA concentration. That means that there is a significant population of MS which size was not influenced by the HAs.
The largest deviations in the PSD corresponded to the absence of HA and the smaller concentration, 
$\mathrm{[HA]  < 2\,mg\;L^{-1}}$.
%Recall that 
%$\mathrm{[HA] =\; 2\; mg\,L^{-1}}$
%was about 30~times the stoichometric rate required for  coating the MS with a monolayer of HA.
This is because the separation between clusters at low [HA] or early times is not well defined. For example, in absence of HA at $24~\mathrm{h}$ incubation the populations assigned to clusters 1 and 2 are very close one to other. On the contrary, with larger HA concentrations and long  times cluster separation is neat.


%% Cluster numero 2 verde 
The cluster no.~2 groups the particles with size in the range from $800$ to $980\;\mathrm{nm}$.
Clusters no.~1 and 2 no not overlap except some extreme values with [HA]$\leq\, 2\;\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$. At times $0 - 24~\mathrm{h}$ and
[HA] in the range $4 - 6~\mathrm{mg\, L^{-1}}$ the variance of PSD decreased, and the size regarding the smaller [HA].
Large variance  and sizes at low [HA] and time $< 24~\mathrm{h}$ is an ''statistical artifact'' that results from the lack of clear separation of the particle size components. So that it not represent a true population.
There is an increase of the particle size in the interval
of [AH] $4-10~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$.
The rate of increase in diameter with the [HA] was
$4.6\,\pm 1.8~\mathrm{nm\,L\,mg^{-1}}$, with a $\mathrm{P = 0.027}$ $r^2 > 0.635$ and 11 degrees of freedom. 
That confirms, that the size of particles in the cluster no. 2 increases significantly with the [HA] and the growth rate manifests at $24~\mathrm{h}$ incubation.

% Pendiente de Realizar puebas estadisticas del modelo lineal (tamaño ~[HA])


%%Cluster numero 3 rojo.
Cluster no. 3 groups the particles with the largest size
($> 980~\mathrm{nm}$). 
 At short times, 
$0.25~\mathrm{h}$,
there was a monotonic increase in size with the [HA] in the range
$2-8~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$.
At larger contact times, 
$24-48~\mathrm{h}$, 
the size increased dramatically 
with a maximum at $\mathrm{[HA]} = 2~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ .
Then, at higher [HA] the size  decreases with a
monotonic decrease that can be clearly observed at 
$48~\mathrm{h}$.
The higest size, $1462~\mathrm{nm}$,
occurred
with
$\mathrm{[HA]} = 2~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}
$ at 
$48~\mathrm{h}$.
This maximum size is equivalent to double the size of particles in the cluster no. 1, indicating that that this size may correspond to MS aggregates. %Laura: comprobar con microscopía, tenemos fotos?

Classification of particles in different sizes was used to analyze the changes in the population distribution in function of time and [HA].
Figure~\ref{fgr:boxplot_populations} shows the distribution of populations,
namely, the fraction of particle counts in each size fraction frequencies 
regarding the influence of [HA].

%Analisis de las poblaciones en el Cluster 1 azul
Populations in the smaller cluster no .1 constitute less than the half of total TRPS counts.  Do not show a clear relation with the [HA] and 
time. 
Only  shows a  significant decrease 
with the [AH] in the range $2-6~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ 
at 
$48~\mathrm{h}$ that can be related with the increase of the larger particles in the cluster no. 3 in the same 

%Analisis de las poblaciones en el Cluster 2 verde
Cluster 2
%($900 - 980~\mathrm{nm}$)
had the highest counts, i.e.
$>\,0.5$ population fraction, 
 at short times
,$0.25~\mathrm{h}$,
with a significant decrease at the maximum [HA], 
$10~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$.
At larger times the population decreased significantly in the range
of [AH] $2-8~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$.
Changes in the particle populations in the cluster no. 2 do not have
significant correspondence  with changes populations in the cluster no. 1.
Only  the  significant decrease  occurred
with [AH] $2-6~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ 
at 
$48~\mathrm{h}$.






%Analisis de las poblaciones en el Cluster 3 rojo
In Cluster 3 
%($ > 980~\mathrm{nm}$)
populations varied in a opposite way as in the cluster no. 2. Figure~\ref{fgr:boxplot_populations}
shows a clear increase in numbers with the [HA] and contact time.
This increase corresponds to a decrease in the particle counts in the cluster no. 2.
%
% Lo que ocurre con 2 mg/L HA (cross linking)
That increase of in size regarding [HA] is not strictly monotonic.
 At concentrations 
$\mathrm{[HA]} = 2~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ 
the  population reached the  minima, $0.12$ and $0.15$ of the total population. These particles correspond
with the largest sizes, doubling the diameter of the primary MS,  
$1300~\mathrm{nm}$ at
$24~\mathrm{h}$ 
and
$1462~\mathrm{nm}$ at
$48~\mathrm{h}$. 
That decrease agree with the flocculation behavior at 
$\mathrm{[HA]} = 2~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ 
discussed above.

\section{Discussion}



%Discusión: floculacion excesiva por elevada fuerza iónica
The suitabiliy of TRPS to study colloid particle sizes
and is limited by the \ce{pH} and ionic strength  values that  control
the flocculation rate. Large aggregates exceeding  the size of the measurement pore in the TRPS cannot be measured.
Fortunately, the optimal conditions fall into the typical values of 
terrestrial aquatic environments.


% Aqui discutimos la parte de la \subsection{Clustering particle sizes}

From these observations it can be drawn some findings  about the HA-MS interactions in presence of \ce{Ca^{2+}}.
First consider that the reference standards MS is not a single unimodal population.
%Laura: pedirle los  datos de las cuentas de calibración para comprobar mediante clustering si la distribución es unimodal o no
TRPS and clustering confirms reported using flow cytometry that the population can be optimally described by three gaussians.
 For example the  high resolution DLS procedure suggested by
 ~\citeauthor{Bryant2003AccurateSuspensions}\cite{Bryant2003AccurateSuspensions} 
reported  that poly(methyl methacrylate)-based particles have negatively
skewed particle size distributions and in many cases could be characterized
by the Weibull extreme value distribution. This type of distribution also
was found by fitting the overall particle size distribution obtained by TRPS. However, statistical clustering on TRPS data can resolve different components.

Second, there is a fraction of MS (Figure~\ref{fgr:boxplot_populations})
that is not influenced by the presence of HA, even in presence of \ce{CaCl2}
and HA at concentrations several times higher than level for complete
covering of the MS surface.

Third, the intermediate component (cluster no. 2) clearly indicates  an
increase in particle size associated with the [HA] and
contact time. The coexistence of different sizes and the
slow  growth rate indicate that the kinetics of HA binding
to MS is slow. Adsorption of HA on PS MS is limited by
transport and electrostatic interactions~ \cite{doi:10.1021/es981236u}.
Double layer interaction calculations (Table~\ref{tbl:dvlo_interaction}) show a small potential gradient  low  repulsion barrier,
so that the attraction force  is small  and range of electrostatic attraction is short $\sim 20~\mathrm{nm}$.
The rate of increase in size is about one  layer of primary particles of HA per $\mathrm{mg HA\,L^{-1}}$ in the suspension.

Fourth, the dramatic increase in size in cluster no. 3 
and subsequent decrease indicates bridging flocculation at 
$\mathrm{[HA] \,=\, 2\;mg\,L^{-1}}$, followed by polymer stabilization at higher [HA]. %% Pendiente de confirmar por microscopía.
Bridging flocculation and polymer stabilization can occur in any colloid that can adsorb dissolved organic matter and in presence of \ce{Ca^{2+}}.

Transition from bridging flocculation to polymer stabilization results from the stoichometry ratio of 
\ce{Ca^{2+}}:HA.
With 
$\mathrm{[HA]} = 2~\mathrm{mg\,L^{-1}}$ there is enough 
\ce{Ca^{2+}} to stabilize HA-MS bindings. However, at higher concentrations
the most
\ce{Ca^{2+}}
can be  complexed by the excess of HA  so that little
\ce{Ca^{2+}}
is available to strength the polymer bridges between ms.
The overall mechanism  result in a slow thickening of the MS coating. 

















 










\section{Conclusions}



TRPS provides a very good resolution in the separation  of particle sizes in polydisperse mixtures.



Alternative techniques to study surface adsorption such as laser-beam reflectometry.

That separation must be accompanied by a careful statistical statistical clustering procedure.

The quality of reparation depends on the neatness definition of subpopulations. A continuous broad distribution of particle sizes cannot bring an statistical separation.

The linear relationship  between particle size growth and [HA] sketches new potential methods based on TRPS to
quantify the influence of coating of MS by HA on the thickening of particles.
